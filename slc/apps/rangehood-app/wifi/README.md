# CHIP SiWx917 SoC RangeHood Example

The SiWx917 SoC RangeHood example provides a baseline demonstration of a Rangehood
device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs simplicity SDK. It can be controlled by
a Matter controller over Wifi network.
    
The SiWx917 SoC device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Matter controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure.
    
The LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the needed commissioning
information for the BLE connection and starting the Rendez-vous procedure.
  
For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Wi-Fi instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Region code Setting (917 WiFi projects)

In Wifi configurations, the region code can be set in this
[file](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/matter_sdk/blob/085bd03532990e5b1f99ff4b08ebce4f4ca5edf6/src/platform/silabs/wifi/SiWx/WifiInterface.cpp#L125).
The available region codes can be found

## RangeHood Application User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

![QR Code](qr_code_img.png)

A URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by pressing BTN0**

**The URL can also be printed by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00
```

Note: This QR Code is only valid for an unprovisioned device. Provisioning may change the QR Code.

**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the RTT logs.

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device. Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset procedure.

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, chip-tool (standalone or pre-built), Android, iOS app or the mattertool utility from the Matter Hub package provided by Silicon Labs. The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)


    
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)

Here is some CHIPTool examples:

Pairing with chip-tool:
```shell
chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <Node-ID> $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840
```
