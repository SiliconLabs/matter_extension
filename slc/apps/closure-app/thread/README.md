# Matter EFR32 Closure Example

The EFR32 Closure example provides a baseline demonstration of a Closure, 
built using Matter and the Silicon Labs Simplicity SDK. It can be controlled
by a Matter controller over an Openthread network.

The EFR32 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Matter controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure. If using Thread, Thread Network credentials are then provided to the
EFR32 device which will then join the Thread network.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the
needed commissioning information for the BLE connection and starting the
Rendez-vous procedure.

The Closure example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform.

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Thread demo instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Closure Example User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

![QR Code](qr_code_img.png)

A URL can be found in the **device logs (RTT or UART) upon startup OR by pressing BTN0**

**The URL can also be printed by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00
```

Note: This QR Code is only valid for an unprovisioned device. Provisioning may change the QR Code.

**LED 0** 

Shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The following states are possible:

-   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ ; The device is in the unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.

-   _Rapid Even Flashing_ ; (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through Bluetooth LE.

-   _Short Flash Off_ ; (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully
provisioned, but does not yet have full Thread network or service connectivity.

-   _Solid On_ ; The device is fully provisioned and has full Thread network and service connectivity.

**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the device logs (RTT or UART).

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device.
 Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset
 procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is
 initiated.

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, chip-tool (standalone or pre-built), Android, iOS app or the mattertool utility from the Matter Hub package provided by Silicon Labs. The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)

More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)


Here is an example with the CHIPTool:

```shell
./chip-tool pairing ble-thread 1 hex:<operationalDataset> 20202021 3840

./chip-tool closurecontrol read cluster-revision 1 1

```
