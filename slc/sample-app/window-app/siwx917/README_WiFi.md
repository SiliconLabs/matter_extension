# Matter SiWx917 SoC Window Covering Example

The SiWx917 SoC window-covering example provides a baseline demonstration of a Window
Covering device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs simplicity SDK. It can be
controlled by a Matter controller over Wifi network.

The SiWx917 SoC device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Matter controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the
needed commissioning information for the BLE connection and starting the
Rendez-vous procedure. Once the device is commissioned, the displays shows a
representation of the window covering state.

The window-covering example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform.

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Wi-Fi demo instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Region code Setting (917 WiFi projects)

In Wifi configurations, the region code can be set in this
[file](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/matter_sdk/blob/085bd03532990e5b1f99ff4b08ebce4f4ca5edf6/src/platform/silabs/wifi/SiWx/WifiInterface.cpp#L125).
The available region codes can be found

## Window Covering Application User Interface

**LCD** 

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

![QR Code](qr_code_img.png)

A URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by pressing BTN0**

**The URL can also be printed by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00
```

Note: This QR Code is only valid for an unprovisioned device. Provisioning may change the QR Code.

**Push Button 0** 

Increase either tilt or lift, and factory reset

-   Pressed and release: The lift/tilt increases by 10%

-   Pressed and hold for 6 s: Initiates the factory reset of the device.
            Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset
            procedure.

Note: The Window app is ICD enabled, and as a result, the **LEDs** and **Push Button 1** are non-functional because they are not connected to any UULP pins on the WPK.

*   Once the device is provisioned, it will join the wifi network is
    established, look for the RTT log

```shell
[DL] Device Role: CHILD
[DL] Partition Id:0x6A7491B7
[DL] \_OnPlatformEvent default: event->Type = 32778
[DL] Wifi State Changed (Flags: 0x00000001)
[DL] Wifi Unicast Addresses:
[DL]    2001:DB8::E1A2:87F1:7D5D:FECA/64 valid preferred
[DL]    FDDE:AD00:BEEF::FF:FE00:2402/64 valid preferred rloc
[DL]    FDDE:AD00:BEEF:0:383F:5E81:A05A:B168/64 valid preferred
[DL]    FE80::D8F2:592E:C109:CF00/64 valid preferred
[DL] LwIP Wifi face addresses updated
[DL] FE80::D8F2:592E:C109:CF00 IPv6 link-local address, preferred)
[DL] FDDE:AD00:BEEF:0:383F:5E81:A05A:B168 Wifi mesh-local address, preferred)
[DL] 2001:DB8::E1A2:87F1:7D5D:FECA IPv6 global unicast address, preferred)
```

(you can verify that the device is on the wifi network with the command
    `router table` using a serial terminal (screen / minicom etc.) on the board
    running the window-app example. You can also get the address list with the
    command ipaddr again in the serial terminal )

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, chip-tool (standalone or pre-built), Android, iOS app or the mattertool utility from the Matter Hub package provided by Silicon Labs. The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.6.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)


    
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md) 

For instance, to set the window covering:

```shell
chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <Node-ID> $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840

./chip-tool windowcovering up-or-open <Node-ID> 1

./chip-tool windowcovering down-or-close <Node-ID> 1
```

To see the supported window covering cluster commands, use:

```shell
chip-tool windowcovering
```
