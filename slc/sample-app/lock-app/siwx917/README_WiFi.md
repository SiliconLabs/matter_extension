# CHIP SiWx917 SoC Lock Example

The SiWx917 SoC lock example provides a baseline demonstration of a door lock control
device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs Gecko SDK. It can be controlled by
a Chip controller over Wifi network.
    
The SiWx917 SoC device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Chip controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure.
    
The LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the needed commissioning
information for the BLE connection and starting the Rendez-vous procedure.
    
The lock example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform. **This example is defaulted to use full ICD functionality
out-of-the-box and therefore has the matter_icd_management component enabled.**

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Wi-Fi instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Lock Application User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the 
CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

On devices that do not have or support the LCD Display like the BRD4166A Thunderboard Sense 2, a URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=CH%3AI34NM%20-00%200C9SS0
```

**LED 0** 

Shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The following states are possible:

-   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ ; The device is in the unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.

-   _Rapid Even Flashing_ ; (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through Bluetooth LE.

-   _Short Flash Off_ ; (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully provisioned, but does not yet have full service connectivity.

-   _Solid On_ ; The device is fully provisioned and has full service connectivity.

**LED 1** 

Simulates the Lock The following states are possible:

-   _Solid On_ ; Bolt is unlocked
-   _Blinking_ ; Bolt is moving to the desired state
-   _Off_ ; Bolt is locked

**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the RTT logs.

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device. Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is initiated.

**Push Button 1** 

- Toggles the bolt state On/Off

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, Chip tool standalone, Android, iOS app or the Matter Hub provided by Silicon Labs. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.3.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)

The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image which is available from Silicon Labs here: [Silicon Labs Matter Hub](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SilabsMatterPi_2.2.1-1.2-extension.zip)
    
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)

Here is some CHIPTool examples:

Pairing with chip-tool:
```shell
chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1122 $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840
```

Set a user:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock set-user OperationType UserIndex UserName UserUniqueId UserStatus UserType CredentialRule node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock set-user 0 1 "mike" 5 1 0 0 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
```

Set a credential:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential OperationType Credential CredentialData UserIndex UserStatus UserType node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential 0 '{ "credentialType": 1, "credentialIndex": 1 }' "123456" 1 null null 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
```

Changing a credential:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential OperationType Credential CredentialData UserIndex UserStatus UserType node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential 2 '{ "credentialType": 1, "credentialIndex": 1 }' "123457" 1 null null 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
```

Get a user:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock get-user UserIndex node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock get-user 1 1 1
```

Unlock door:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock unlock-door node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock unlock-door 1 1
```

Lock door:
```shell
./out/chip-tool doorlock lock-door node-id/group-id

./out/chip-tool doorlock lock-door 1 1
```
