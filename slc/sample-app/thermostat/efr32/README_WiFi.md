# Matter EFR32 Thermostat Example

The EFR32 Thermostat example provides a baseline demonstration of a thermostat
device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs Gecko SDK. It can be controlled
by a Chip controller over Wifi network.

The EFR32 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Chip controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the
needed commissioning information for the BLE connection and starting the
Rendez-vous procedure.

The light switch example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform.

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Wi-Fi demo instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Thermostat Application User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

On devices that do not have or support the LCD Display like the BRD4166A Thunderboard Sense 2, a URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=CH%3AI34NM%20-00%200C9SS0
```

**LED 0** 

LED 0 shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The following states are possible:

-   Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off): The device is in the unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.

-   Rapid Even Flashing (100 ms on/100 ms off): The device is in the unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through Bluetooth LE.

-   Short Flash Off (950ms on/50ms off): The device is fully provisioned, but does not yet have full service connectivity.

-   Solid On: The device is fully provisioned and has full service connectivity.

**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the RTT logs.

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device. Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is initiated.

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, Chip tool standalone, Android, iOS app or the Matter Hub provided by Silicon Labs. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.3.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)

The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image which is available from Silicon Labs here: [Silicon Labs Matter Hub](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SilabsMatterPi_2.3.0-1.3-extension.zip)
    
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)

Here is an example for provisioning the thermostat application with the chip-tool:

Pairing with chip-tool:
```shell
./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <node-id> $SSID $PSK <PinCode> <Discriminator>

./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840
```

Setting the occupied cooling setpoint:
```shell
./chip-tool thermostat write occupied-cooling-setpoint <temperature> <node-id> <endpoint-id>

./chip-tool thermostat write occupied-cooling-setpoint 2500 1 1

Note: On chip-tool verify that DUT sends a success response
[1676031143.386639][19597:19599] CHIP:DMG:                         StatusIB =
[1676031143.386683][19597:19599] CHIP:DMG:                         {
[1676031143.386729][19597:19599] CHIP:DMG:                                 status = 0x00 (SUCCESS),
[1676031143.386773][19597:19599] CHIP:DMG:                         },
```
Read thermostat attributes:
```shell
./chip-tool thermostat read occupied-cooling-setpoint <node-id> <endpoint-id>

./chip-tool thermostat read occupied-cooling-setpoint 1 1

Note: On chip-tool verify that the occupied cooling setpoint attribute value which is provided in previous step
[1676028659.980049][19359:19361] CHIP:TOO:   OccupiedCoolingSetpoint: 2500
```
