# Matter SiWx917 SoC Air Quality Sensor Example

The SiWx917 SoC Air Quality Sensor example provides a baseline demonstration of a Air Quality Sensor
device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs Gecko SDK. It can be controlled
by a Chip controller over Wifi network.

The SiWx917 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Chip controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the
needed commissioning information for the BLE connection and starting the
Rendez-vous procedure.

The Air Quality Sensor example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform.

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Wi-Fi instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Air Quality Sensor Example User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

On devices that do not have or support the LCD Display like BRD2601B, a URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=CH%3AI34NM%20-00%200C9SS0
```

**LED 0** 

Shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The following states are possible:

-   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ ; The device is in the unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.

-   _Rapid Even Flashing_ ; (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through Bluetooth LE.

-   _Short Flash Off_ ; (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully
provisioned, but does not yet have full service
connectivity.

-   _Solid On_ ; The device is fully provisioned and has full service connectivity.

**LED 1** 

Simulates the Light The following states are possible:

-   _Solid On_ ; Light is on
-   _Off_ ; Light is off

    
**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the RTT logs.

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device.
 Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset
 procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is
 initiated.

**Push Button 1** 

- Toggles the light state On/Off

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, chip-tool (standalone or pre-built), Android, iOS app or the mattertool utility from the Matter Hub package provided by Silicon Labs. The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.3.2/matter-thread/raspi-img)
   
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)


Here is an example with the CHIPTool:

```shell
chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1122 $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840

chip-tool onoff on 1 1
```
