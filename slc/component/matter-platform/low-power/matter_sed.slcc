  Sleepy support for Thread applications and compatability with Matter sleepy end devices. This component
  enables ultra low power consumption while in idle mode. Polling, wake, and active 
  time frames can be further manipulated within sl_matter_sleepy_config.h. This component 
  requires that the Thread MTD library be used. Components that must be disabled when
  using a Matter Sleepy End Device include: Matter shell, OpenThread CLI, UART, QR code display,
  and LCD.
