label: Subscription Timout Resumption
description: >
  Provides a retry mechanism for devices to re-establish a lost subscription 
  with a client. This component is enabled by default on most Silicon Labs Matter
  applications (door-lock and light-switch not included). This component conflicts
  with full ICD functionality (matter_icd) as it can cause an increase in power consumption.
