  Implementation of the Icd Management Server Cluster. ICD support for Matter end devices.
  This component enables ultra low power consumption while in idle mode. Polling, wake, 
  and active time frames can be further manipulated within ICDServerBuildConfig.h. This 
  component requires that the Thread MTD library be used. This component conflicts with
  matter_subscription_timeout_resumption as it can cause an increase in power consumption 
  if both are enabled. Components that must be disabled when using a Matter ICD End Device
  to achieve the most optimial power consumption include: Matter shell, OpenThread CLI, UART, 
  QR code display, and LCD. The user has to enable the Icd Management Server Cluster in the Zigbee Cluster Configurator (ZAP) in order to enable this functionality.
