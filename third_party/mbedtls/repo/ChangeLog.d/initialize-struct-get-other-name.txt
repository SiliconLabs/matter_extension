Bugfix
   * Fix an issue when parsing an otherName subject alternative name into a
     mbedtls_x509_san_other_name struct. The type-id of the otherName was not
     copied to the struct. This meant that the struct had incomplete
     information about the otherName SAN and contained uninitialized memory.
   * Fix the detection of HardwareModuleName otherName SANs. These were being
     detected by comparing the wrong field and the check was erroneously
     inverted.
