This directory contains the `pw` Digital IO Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
This HAL defines interfaces for working with Digital IO lines that provide
different combinations of capabilities (input, output, and/or interrupts).
Hardware specific backends provide implementations of these interfaces for
different hardware platforms.

Warning: This module is under construction and may not be ready for use.
