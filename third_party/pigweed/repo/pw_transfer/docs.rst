  ``pw_transfer`` is under construction and so is its documentation.

-----
Usage
-----

C++
===
The transfer service is defined and registered with an RPC server like any other
RPC service.

To know how to read data from or write data to device, a ``TransferHandler``
interface is defined (``pw_transfer/public/pw_transfer/handler.h``). Transfer
handlers represent a transferable resource, wrapping a stream reader and/or
writer with initialization and completion code. Custom transfer handler
implementations should derive from ``ReadOnlyHandler``, ``WriteOnlyHandler``,
or ``ReadWriteHandler`` as appropriate and override Prepare and Finalize methods
if necessary.

A transfer handler should be implemented and instantiated for each unique data
transfer to or from a device. These handlers are then registered with the
transfer service using their resource IDs.

**Example**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include "pw_transfer/transfer.h"

  namespace {

  // Simple transfer handler which reads data from an in-memory buffer.
  class SimpleBufferReadHandler : public pw::transfer::ReadOnlyHandler {
   public:
    SimpleReadTransfer(uint32_t resource_id, pw::ConstByteSpan data)
        : ReadOnlyHandler(resource_id), reader_(data) {
      set_reader(reader_);
    }

   private:
    pw::stream::MemoryReader reader_;
  };

  // The maximum amount of data that can be sent in a single chunk, excluding
  // transport layer overhead.
  constexpr size_t kMaxChunkSizeBytes = 256;

  // In a write transfer, the maximum number of bytes to receive at one time,
  // (potentially across multiple chunks), unless specified otherwise by the
  // transfer handler's stream::Writer.
  constexpr size_t kDefaultMaxBytesToReceive = 1024;

  // Instantiate a static transfer service.
  // The service requires a work queue, and a buffer to store data from a chunk.
  // The helper class TransferServiceBuffer comes with a builtin buffer.
  pw::transfer::TransferServiceBuffer<kMaxChunkSizeBytes> transfer_service(
      GetSystemWorkQueue(), kDefaultMaxBytesToReceive);

  // Instantiate a handler for the data to be transferred. The resource ID will
  // be used by the transfer client and server to identify the handler.
  constexpr uint32_t kBufferResourceId = 1;
  char buffer_to_transfer[256] = { /* ... */ };
  SimpleBufferReadHandler buffer_handler(kBufferResourceId, buffer_to_transfer);

  }  // namespace

  void InitTransfer() {
    // Register the handler with the transfer service, then the transfer service
    // with an RPC server.
    transfer_service.RegisterHandler(buffer_handler);
    GetSystemRpcServer().RegisterService(transfer_service);
  }

Module Configuration Options
----------------------------
The following configurations can be adjusted via compile-time configuration of
this module, see the
:ref:`module documentation <module-structure-compile-time-configuration>` for
more details.

.. c:macro:: PW_TRANSFER_DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES

  The default maximum number of times a transfer should retry sending a chunk
  when no response is received. This can later be configured per-transfer.

.. c:macro:: PW_TRANSFER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS

  The default amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for a chunk to arrive
  before retrying. This can later be configured per-transfer.

.. c:macro:: PW_TRANSFER_DEFAULT_EXTEND_WINDOW_DIVISOR

  The fractional position within a window at which a receive transfer should
  extend its window size to minimize the amount of time the transmitter
  spends blocked.

  For example, a divisor of 2 will extend the window when half of the
  requested data has been received, a divisor of three will extend at a third
  of the window, and so on.

Python
======
.. automodule:: pw_transfer
  :members: ProgressStats, Manager, Error

**Example**

.. code-block:: python

  import pw_transfer

  # Initialize a Pigweed RPC client; see pw_rpc docs for more info.
  rpc_client = CustomRpcClient()
  rpcs = rpc_client.channel(1).rpcs

  transfer_service = rpcs.pw.transfer.Transfer
  transfer_manager = pw_transfer.Manager(transfer_service)

  try:
    # Read the transfer resource with ID 3 from the server.
    data = transfer_manager.read(3)
  except pw_transfer.Error as err:
    print('Failed to read:', err.status)

  try:
    # Send some data to the server. The transfer manager does not have to be
    # reinitialized.
    transfer_manager.write(2, b'hello, world')
  except pw_transfer.Error as err:
    print('Failed to write:', err.status)

Typescript
==========

Provides a simple interface for transferring bulk data over pw_rpc.

**Example**

.. code-block:: typescript

   import { pw_transfer } from 'pigweedjs';
   const { Manager } from pw_transfer;

   const client = new CustomRpcClient();
   service = client.channel()!.service('pw.transfer.Transfer')!;

   const manager = new Manager(service, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S);

   manager.read(3, (stats: ProgressStats) => {
     console.log(`Progress Update: ${stats}`);
   }).then((data: Uint8Array) => {
     console.log(`Completed read: ${data}`);
   }).catch(error => {
     console.log(`Failed to read: ${error.status}`);
   });

   manager.write(2, textEncoder.encode('hello world'))
     .catch(error => {
       console.log(`Failed to read: ${error.status}`);
     });

Protocol errors
---------------
At any point, either the client or server may terminate the transfer with a
status code. The transfer chunk with the status is the final chunk of the
transfer.

The following table describes the meaning of each status code when sent by the
sender or the receiver (see `Transfer roles`_).

.. cpp:namespace-push:: pw::stream

+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| Status                  | Sent by sender          | Sent by receiver        |

|                         |                         | and handled             |
|                         |                         | successfully.           |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``ABORTED``             | The service aborted the transfer because the      |
|                         | client restarted it. This status is passed to the |
|                         | transfer handler, but not sent to the client      |
|                         | because it restarted the transfer.                |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| ``CANCELLED``           | The client cancelled the transfer.                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``DATA_LOSS``           | Failed to read the data | Failed to write the     |

+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``INTERNAL``            | An assumption of the protocol was violated.       |
|                         | Encountering ``INTERNAL`` indicates that there is |
|                         | a bug in the service or client implementation.    |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``PERMISSION_DENIED``   | The transfer does not support the requested       |
|                         | operation (either reading or writing).            |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED``  | The receiver requested  | Storage is full.        |
|                         | zero bytes, indicating  |                         |
|                         | their storage is full,  |                         |
|                         | but there is still data |                         |
|                         | to send.                |                         |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| ``UNAVAILABLE``         | The service is busy with other transfers and      |
|                         | cannot begin a new transfer at this time.         |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

Client errors
-------------
``pw_transfer`` clients may immediately return certain errors if they cannot
start a transfer.

.. list-table::

  * - **Status**
    - **Reason**
  * - ``ALREADY_EXISTS``
    - A transfer with the requested ID is already pending on this client.
  * - ``DATA_LOSS``
    - Sending the initial transfer chunk failed.
  * - ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED``
    - The client has insufficient resources to start an additional transfer at
      this time.


Transfer roles
==============
Every transfer has two participants: the sender and the receiver. The sender
transmits data to the receiver. The receiver controls how the data is
transferred and sends the final status when the transfer is complete.

In read transfers, the client is the receiver and the service is the sender. In
write transfers, the client is the sender and the service is the receiver.

Integration tests
-----------------
The ``pw_transfer`` module has a set of integration tests that verify the
correctness of implementations in different languages.
`Test source code <https://cs.pigweed.dev/pigweed/+/main:pw_transfer/integration_test/>`_.

To run the tests on your machine, run

.. code:: bash

  $ bazel run pw_transfer/integration_test:cross_language_integration_test

The integration tests permit injection of client/server/proxy binaries to use
when running the tests. This allows manual testing of older versions of
pw_transfer against newer versions.

.. code:: bash

  # Test a newer version of pw_transfer against an old C++ client that was
  # backed up to another directory.
  $ bazel run pw_transfer/integration_test:cross_language_integration_test -- \
      --cpp-client ../old_pw_transfer_version/cpp_client

CI/CQ integration
=================
`Current status of the test in CI <https://ci.chromium.org/p/pigweed/builders/ci/pigweed-integration-transfer>`_.

By default, these tests are not run in CQ (on presubmit) because they are too
slow. However, you can request that the tests be run in presubmit on your
change by adding to following line to the commit message footer:

.. code::
