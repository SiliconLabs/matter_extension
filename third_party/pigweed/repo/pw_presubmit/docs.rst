============
pw_presubmit
============
The presubmit module provides Python tools for running presubmit checks and
checking and fixing code format. It also includes the presubmit check script for
the Pigweed repository, ``pigweed_presubmit.py``.

Presubmit checks are essential tools, but they take work to set up, and
projects don’t always get around to it. The ``pw_presubmit`` module provides
tools for setting up high quality presubmit checks for any project. We use this
framework to run Pigweed’s presubmit on our workstations and in our automated
building tools.

The ``pw_presubmit`` module also includes ``pw format``, a tool that provides a
unified interface for automatically formatting code in a variety of languages.
With ``pw format``, you can format Bazel, C, C++, Python, GN, and Go code
according to configurations defined by your project. ``pw format`` leverages
existing tools like ``clang-format``, and it’s simple to add support for new
languages. (Note: Bazel formatting requires ``buildifier`` to be present on your
system. If it's not Bazel formatting passes without checking.)

The ``pw_presubmit`` package includes presubmit checks that can be used with any
project. These checks include:

* Check code format of several languages including C, C++, and Python
* Initialize a Python environment
* Run all Python tests
* Run pylint
* Run mypy
* Ensure source files are included in the GN and Bazel builds
* Build and run all tests with GN
* Build and run all tests with Bazel
* Ensure all header files contain ``#pragma once``

-------------------------------------------
Creating a presubmit check for your project
-------------------------------------------
Creating a presubmit check for a project using ``pw_presubmit`` is simple, but
requires some customization. Projects must define their own presubmit check
Python script that uses the ``pw_presubmit`` package.

A project's presubmit script can be registered as a
:ref:`pw_cli <module-pw_cli>` plugin, so that it can be run as ``pw
presubmit``.

Setting up the command-line interface
=====================================
The ``pw_presubmit.cli`` module sets up the command-line interface for a
presubmit script. This defines a standard set of arguments for invoking
presubmit checks. Its use is optional, but recommended.

pw_presubmit.cli
----------------
.. automodule:: pw_presubmit.cli
   :members: add_arguments, run

Presubmit output directory
--------------------------
The ``pw_presubmit`` command line interface includes an ``--output-directory``
option that specifies the working directory to use for presubmits. The default
path is ``out/presubmit``.  A subdirectory is created for each presubmit step.
This directory persists between presubmit runs and can be cleaned by deleting it
or running ``pw presubmit --clean``.

Presubmit checks
================
A presubmit check is defined as a function or other callable. The function must
accept one argument: a ``PresubmitContext``, which provides the paths on which
to run. Presubmit checks communicate failure by raising an exception.

Presubmit checks may use the ``filter_paths`` decorator to automatically filter
the paths list for file types they care about.

Either of these functions could be used as presubmit checks:

.. code-block:: python

  @pw_presubmit.filter_paths(endswith='.py')
  def file_contains_ni(ctx: PresubmitContext):
      for path in ctx.paths:
          with open(path) as file:
              contents = file.read()
              if 'ni' not in contents and 'nee' not in contents:
                  raise PresumitFailure('Files must say "ni"!', path=path)

  def run_the_build(_):
      subprocess.run(['make', 'release'], check=True)

Presubmit checks functions are grouped into "programs" -- a named series of
checks. Projects may find it helpful to have programs for different purposes,
such as a quick program for local use and a full program for automated use. The
:ref:`example script <example-script>` uses ``pw_presubmit.Programs`` to define
``quick`` and ``full`` programs.

``PresubmitContext`` has the following members:

* ``root``: Source checkout root directory
* ``repos``: Repositories (top-level and submodules) processed by
  ``pw presubmit``
* ``output_dir``: Output directory for this specific presubmit step
* ``failure_summary_log``: File path where steps should write a brief summary
  of any failures
* ``paths``: Modified files for the presubmit step to check (often used in
  formatting steps but ignored in compile steps)
* ``all_paths``: All files in the repository tree.
* ``package_root``: Root directory for ``pw package`` installations
* ``override_gn_args``: Additional GN args processed by ``build.gn_gen()``
* ``luci``: Information about the LUCI build or None if not running in LUCI
* ``num_jobs``: Number of jobs to run in parallel
* ``continue_after_build_error``: For steps that compile, don't exit on the
  first compilation error
* ``rng_seed``: Seed from ``--rng-seed`` or 1, for the few steps that need to
  seed a random number generator

The ``luci`` member is of type ``LuciContext`` and has the following members:

* ``buildbucket_id``: The globally-unique buildbucket id of the build
* ``build_number``: The builder-specific incrementing build number, if
  configured for this builder
* ``project``: The LUCI project under which this build is running (often
  ``pigweed`` or ``pigweed-internal``)
* ``bucket``: The LUCI bucket under which this build is running (often ends
  with ``ci`` or ``try``)
* ``builder``: The builder being run
* ``swarming_server``: The swarming server on which this build is running
* ``swarming_task_id``: The swarming task id of this build
* ``cas_instance``: The CAS instance accessible from this build
* ``pipeline``: Information about the build pipeline, if applicable.
* ``triggers``: Information about triggering commits, if applicable.

The ``pipeline`` member, if present, is of type ``LuciPipeline`` and has the
following members:

* ``round``: The zero-indexed round number.
* ``builds_from_previous_iteration``: A list of the buildbucket ids from the
  previous round, if any, encoded as strs.

The ``triggers`` member is a sequence of ``LuciTrigger`` objects, which have the
following members:

* ``number``: The number of the change in Gerrit.
* ``patchset``: The number of the patchset of the change.
* ``remote``: The full URL of the remote.
* ``branch``: The name of the branch on which this change is being/was
  submitted.
* ``ref``: The ``refs/changes/..`` path that can be used to reference the
  patch for unsubmitted changes and the hash for submitted changes.
* ``gerrit_name``: The name of the googlesource.com Gerrit host.
* ``submitted``: Whether the change has been submitted or is still pending.

Additional members can be added by subclassing ``PresubmitContext`` and
``Presubmit``. Then override ``Presubmit._create_presubmit_context()`` to
return the subclass of ``PresubmitContext``. Finally, add
``presubmit_class=PresubmitSubClass`` when calling ``cli.run()``.

Substeps
--------
Presubmit steps can define substeps that can run independently in other tooling.
These steps should subclass ``SubStepCheck`` and must define a ``substeps()``
method that yields ``SubStep`` objects. ``SubStep`` objects have the following
members:

* ``name``: Name of the substep
* ``_func``: Substep code
* ``args``: Positional arguments for ``_func``
* ``kwargs``: Keyword arguments for ``_func``

``SubStep`` objects must have unique names. For a detailed example of a
``SubStepCheck`` subclass see ``GnGenNinja`` in ``build.py``.

Existing Presubmit Checks
-------------------------
A small number of presubmit checks are made available through ``pw_presubmit``
modules.

Code Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Formatting checks for a variety of languages are available from
``pw_presubmit.format_code``. These include C/C++, Java, Go, Python, GN, and
others. All of these checks can be included by adding
``pw_presubmit.format_code.presubmit_checks()`` to a presubmit program. These
all use language-specific formatters like clang-format or black.

These will suggest fixes using ``pw format --fix``.

Options for code formatting can be specified in the ``pigweed.json`` file
(see also :ref:`SEED-0101 <seed-0101>`). These apply to both ``pw presubmit``
steps that check code formatting and ``pw format`` commands that either check
or fix code formatting.

* ``python_formatter``: Choice of Python formatter. Options are ``black`` (used
  by Pigweed itself) and ``yapf`` (the default).
* ``black_path``: If ``python_formatter`` is ``black``, use this as the
  executable instead of ``black``.
* ``black_config_file``: Set the config file for the black formatter.
* ``exclude``: List of path regular expressions to ignore. Will be evaluated
  against paths relative to the checkout root using ``re.search``.

Example section from a ``pigweed.json`` file:

.. code-block::

  {
    "pw": {
      "pw_presubmit": {
        "format": {
          "python_formatter": "black",
          "black_config_file": "$pw_env{PW_PROJECT_ROOT}/config/.black.toml"
          "black_path": "black",
          "exclude": [
            "\\bthird_party/foo/src"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }

Sorted Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Blocks of code can be required to be kept in sorted order using comments like
the following:

.. code-block::

  # keep-sorted: start
  bar
  baz
  foo
  # keep-sorted: end

This can be included by adding ``pw_presubmit.keep_sorted.presubmit_check`` to a
presubmit program. Adding ``ignore-case`` to the start line will use
case-insensitive sorting.

By default, duplicates will be removed. Lines that are identical except in case
are preserved, even with ``ignore-case``. To allow duplicates, add
``allow-dupes`` to the start line.

Prefixes can be ignored by adding ``ignore-prefix=`` followed by a
comma-separated list of prefixes. The list below will be kept in this order.
Neither commas nor whitespace are supported in prefixes.

.. code-block::

  # keep-sorted: start ignore-prefix=',"
  'bar',
  "baz",
  'foo',
  # keep-sorted: end

Inline comments are assumed to be associated with the following line. For
example, the following is already sorted. This can be disabled with
``sticky-comments=no``.

.. todo-check: disable

.. code-block::

  # keep-sorted: start
  # TODO(b/1234) Fix this.
  bar,
  # TODO(b/5678) Also fix this.
  foo,
  # keep-sorted: end

.. todo-check: enable

By default, the prefix of the keep-sorted line is assumed to be the comment
marker used by any inline comments. This can be overridden by adding lines like
``sticky-comments=%,#`` to the start line.

Lines indented more than the preceding line are assumed to be continuations.
Thus, the following block is already sorted. keep-sorted blocks can not be
nested, so there's no ability to add a keep-sorted block for the sub-items.

.. code-block::

  # keep-sorted: start
  * abc
    * xyz
    * uvw
  * def
  # keep-sorted: end

The presubmit check will suggest fixes using ``pw keep-sorted --fix``.

Future versions may support additional multiline list items.

.gitmodules
^^^^^^^^^^^
Various rules can be applied to .gitmodules files. This check can be included
by adding ``pw_presubmit.gitmodules.create()`` to a presubmit program. This
function takes an optional argument of type ``pw_presubmit.gitmodules.Config``.
``Config`` objects have several properties.

* ``allow_submodules: bool = True`` — If false, don't allow any submodules.
* ``allow_non_googlesource_hosts: bool = False`` — If false, all submodule URLs
  must be on a Google-managed Gerrit server.
* ``allowed_googlesource_hosts: Sequence[str] = ()`` — If set, any
  Google-managed Gerrit URLs for submodules most be in this list. Entries
  should be like ``pigweed`` for ``pigweed-review.googlesource.com``.
* ``require_relative_urls: bool = False`` — If true, all submodules must be
  relative to the superproject remote.
* ``allow_sso: bool = True`` — If false, ``sso://`` and ``rpc://`` submodule
  URLs are prohibited.
* ``allow_git_corp_google_com: bool = True`` — If false, ``git.corp.google.com``
  submodule URLs are prohibited.
* ``require_branch: bool = False`` — If true, all submodules must reference a
  branch.
* ``validator: Callable[[PresubmitContext, Path, str, Dict[str, str]], None] = None``
  — A function that can be used for arbitrary submodule validation. It's called
  with the ``PresubmitContext``, the path to the ``.gitmodules`` file, the name
  of the current submodule, and the properties of the current submodule.

#pragma once
^^^^^^^^^^^^
There's a ``pragma_once`` check that confirms the first non-comment line of
C/C++ headers is ``#pragma once``. This is enabled by adding
``pw_presubmit.cpp_checks.pragma_once`` to a presubmit program.

.. todo-check: disable

TODO(b/###) Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There's a check that confirms ``TODO`` lines match a given format. Upstream
Pigweed expects these to look like ``TODO(b/###): Explanation``, but makes it
easy for projects to define their own pattern instead.

To use this check add ``todo_check.create(todo_check.BUGS_OR_USERNAMES)`` to a
presubmit program.

.. todo-check: enable

Python Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two checks in the ``pw_presubmit.python_checks`` module, ``gn_pylint``
and ``gn_python_check``. They assume there's a top-level ``python`` GN target.
``gn_pylint`` runs Pylint and Mypy checks and ``gn_python_check`` runs Pylint,
Mypy, and all Python tests.

Inclusive Language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. inclusive-language: disable

The inclusive language check looks for words that are typical of non-inclusive
code, like using "master" and "slave" in place of "primary" and "secondary" or
"sanity check" in place of "consistency check".

.. inclusive-language: enable

These checks can be disabled for individual lines with
"inclusive-language: ignore" on the line in question or the line above it, or
for entire blocks by using "inclusive-language: disable" before the block and
"inclusive-language: enable" after the block.

.. In case things get moved around in the previous paragraphs the enable line
.. is repeated here: inclusive-language: enable.

OWNERS
^^^^^^
There's a check that requires folders matching specific patterns contain
``OWNERS`` files. It can be included by adding
``module_owners.presubmit_check()`` to a presubmit program. This function takes
a callable as an argument that indicates, for a given file, where a controlling
``OWNERS`` file should be, or returns None if no ``OWNERS`` file is necessary.
Formatting of ``OWNERS`` files is handled similary to formatting of other
source files and is discussed in `Code Formatting`.

JSON
^^^^
The JSON check requires all ``*.json`` files to be valid JSON files. It can be
included by adding ``json_check.presubmit_check()`` to a presubmit program.

Source in Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pigweed provides checks that source files are configured as part of the build
for GN, Bazel, and CMake. These can be included by adding
``source_in_build.gn(filter)`` and similar functions to a presubmit check. The
CMake check additionally requires a callable that invokes CMake with appropriate
options.

pw_presubmit
------------
.. automodule:: pw_presubmit
   :members: filter_paths, FileFilter, call, PresubmitFailure, Programs

.. _example-script:


Git hook
--------
You can run a presubmit program or step as a `git hook
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks>`_ using
``pw_presubmit.install_hook``.  This can be used to run certain presubmit
checks before a change is pushed to a remote.

We strongly recommend that you only run fast (< 15 seconds) and trivial checks
as push hooks, and perform slower or more complex ones in CI. This is because,

* Running slow checks in the push hook will force you to wait longer for
  ``git push`` to complete, and
* If your change fails one of the checks at this stage, it will not yet be
  uploaded to the remote, so you'll have a harder time debugging any failures
  (sharing the change with your colleagues, linking to it from an issue
  tracker, etc).

Example
=======
A simple example presubmit check script follows. This can be copied-and-pasted
to serve as a starting point for a project's presubmit check script.

See ``pigweed_presubmit.py`` for a more complex presubmit check script example.

Code formatting tools

external code format tools. The file ``format_code.py`` can be invoked directly
from the command line or from ``pw`` as ``pw format``.
