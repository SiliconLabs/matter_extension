      The type of Zephyr pw_log backend to use.

      Once the Pigweed logging is enabled, all Pigweed logs via PW_LOG_*() will
      be routed to the Zephyr logging system. This means that:
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_DBG
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_INFO maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_INF
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_WARN maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_WRN
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR
      - PW_LOG_LEVEL_FATAL maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR

      Map all the Zephyr log macros to use Pigweed's then use the
      'pw_log_tokenized' target as the logging backend in order to
      automatically tokenize all the logging strings. This means that Pigweed
      will also tokenize all of Zephyr's logging statements.
