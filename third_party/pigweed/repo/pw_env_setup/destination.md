# Pigweed Environment Directory

This is the directory into which Pigweed installed its environment. In general,
it's acceptable to delete this entire directory, but don't delete any files
within this directory without deleting the entire directory or there may be
strange results.

After deleting this directory, run `. bootstrap.sh` or `bootstrap.bat` instead
of `. activate.sh` or `activate.bat`.
