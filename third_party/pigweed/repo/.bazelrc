# By default build with C++17.

# This leaks the PATH variable into the Bazel build environment, which
# enables the Python pw_protobuf plugins to find the Python version
# via CIPD and pw_env_setup. This is a partial fix for pwbug/437,
# however this does not provide a fix for downstream projects that
# use system Python < 3.6. This approach is problematic because of the
# Protobuf rebuild sensitivity to environment variable changes.
# TODO(pwbug/437): Remove this once pwbug/437 is completely resolved.
