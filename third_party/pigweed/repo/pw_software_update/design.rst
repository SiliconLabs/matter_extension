pw_software_update: Design
--------------------------

This page explains the security framing, bundle format and update workflows of
``pw_software_update``.

Embedded TUF
------------

At the heart, the ``pw_software_update`` module leverages
`The Update Framework <https://theupdateframework.io/>`_ (TUF),
an industry-leading software update security framework that is open, flexible,
and offers a balanced security and privacy treatment.

The ``pw_software_update`` module implements the following building blocks
around TUF.

              C --> |Publish| D[(Available updates)]
              D --> |OTA| E[Device]

Update bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update bundles represent software releases packaged ready for delivery. A bundle
is essentially an archived folder matching the following structure::

  /
  ├── root_metadata
  ├── targets_metadata
  └── targets
      ├── release_notes.txt
      ├── manifest.txt
      ├── rtos.bin
      └── app.bin

Bundles are encoded as serialized "protocol buffers".

Key structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an optimization and trade-off for embedded projects, ``pw_software_update``
only supports the "root" and "targets" roles, as represented by
``root_metadata`` and ``targets_metadata``.

.. mermaid::

       flowchart LR
              A[Verified boot] --> |Embed & Verify| B[/Root key/]
              B --> |Delegate & Rotate| C[/Targets key/]
              C --> |Sign| D[/Target files/]


The "root" role delegates the "targets" role to directly authorize each release.

The "root" role can regularly rotate the "targets" role, in effect revoking
older versions once a new release is available.

The "root" role is the "root of trust" for software update and tied into
verified boot. Due to security risks, ``pw_software_update`` does not use
persistent metadata caches that are not covered by verified boot.

Signing service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Production signing keys MUST be kept secure and clean. That means we must
carefully control access, log usage details, and revoke the key if it was
(accidentally) used to sign a "questionable" build.

This is easier with a signing server built around a key management service.

.. mermaid::

              actor Releaser

              Releaser->>Signer: Sign my bundle with my key, please.

              activate Signer

              Signer->>Signer: Check permission.
              Signer->>Signer: Validate & sign bundle.
              Signer->>Signer: Log action. Email alerts.
              Signer-->>Releaser: Done!
              deactivate Signer

We don't yet have a public-facing service. External users should source their
own solution.

Bundle verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. mermaid::

       flowchart LR
              A[(Incoming bundle)] --> |UpdateBundleAccessor| B[/Verified target files/]


The :cpp:type:`UpdateBundleAccessor` decodes, verifies, and exposes the target
files from an incoming bundle. This class hides the details of the bundle
format and verification flow from callers.

Update workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the device side, :cpp:type:`BundledUpdateService` orchestrates an update
session end-to-end. It drives the backend via a :cpp:type:`BundledUpdateBackend`
interface.

:cpp:type:`BundledUpdateService` is invoked via :ref:`module-pw_rpc` after an
incoming bundle is staged via :ref:`module-pw_transfer`.

Tooling
^^^^^^^

``pw_software_update`` provides the following tooling support for development
and integration.

The python package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pw_software_update`` comes with a python package of the same name, providing
the following functionalities.

  - Local signing key generation for development.
  - TUF root metadata generation and signing.
  - Bundle generation, signing, and verification.
  - Signing server integration.

A typical use of the package is for build system integration.

The command line utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pw update ...`` CLI (Command Line Interface) is a user-friendly interface
to the ``pw_software_update`` python package.

You can use the CLI to quickly learn and prototype a software update system
based on ``pw_software_update`` on your development PC before productionizing
one. In the future you will be able to use the CLI to update a reference
target.

.. code:: bash

       sub-commands:

              generate-key
              create-root-metadata
              sign-root-metadata
              inspect-root-metadata
              create-empty-bundle
