# Pigweed

Pigweed is an open source collection of embedded-targeted librariesâ€“or as we
like to call them, modules. These modules are building blocks and infrastructure
that enable faster and more reliable development on small-footprint MMU-less
32-bit microcontrollers like the STMicroelectronics STM32L452 or the Nordic
nRF52832.
