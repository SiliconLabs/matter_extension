# The PW_PLUGINS file lists commands that should be included with the pw command
# when it is invoked in this directory or its subdirectories. Commands in this
# file override those registered in parent directories.
#
# Entries in this file have three columns:
#
#   <name> <Python module> <function>
#
# The Python package containing that module must be installed in the Pigweed
# virtual environment. The function must have no required arguments and should
# return an int to use as the exit code.
