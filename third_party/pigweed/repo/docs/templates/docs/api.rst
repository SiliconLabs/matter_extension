.. _module-MODULE_NAME-api:

=============
API Reference
=============
..
  If a module includes a developer-facing API, this is the place to include API
  documentation. This doc may be omitted for experimental modules that are not
  yet ready for public use.

  A module may have APIs for multiple languages. If so, replace this file with
  an `api` directory and an `index.rst` file that links to separate docs for
  each supported language.
