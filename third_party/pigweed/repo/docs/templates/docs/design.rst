  This doc provides background on how a module works internally, the assumptions
  inherent in its design, why this particular design was chosen over others, and
  other topics of that nature.

  This doc is only required when the "Design considerations" section in the
  index becomes large enough that a separate doc is needed to maintain
  readability.  If *this* doc becomes too large, it can be replaced with a
  ``design`` subdirectory.
