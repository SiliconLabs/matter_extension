  Tutorials are primarily learning-oriented; they are designed to teach the user
  about a concept or feature so that they can achieve basic competence.

  If your module has tutorials, this index should link to each of them so that
  they're populated in the table of contents. Also consider adding narrative
  instead of simply adding a bulleted list. Guide the user through the
  curriculum they should follow to become knowledgable about the module.
