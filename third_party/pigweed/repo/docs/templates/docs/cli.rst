  If the module has a command-line interface, document that here. For Python
  CLIs, the `sphinx-argparse package
  <https://sphinx-argparse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html>`_ makes this
  very simple and is already included in Pigweed. This doc may be omitted for
  experimental modules that are not yet ready for public use.
