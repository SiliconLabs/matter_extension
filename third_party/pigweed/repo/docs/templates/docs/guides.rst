  Guides are task-oriented. They are essentially steps or recipe a user should
  follow to complete a particular goal.

  Each module should have a minimum of two guides: one guide on how to integrate
  the module with the user's project, and one guide on the most common use case
  for the module. Most modules ought to have many more guides than this.

  If this document becomes to large and difficult to navigate, replace it with a
  ``guides`` subdirectory.
