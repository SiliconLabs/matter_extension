"""Framework for configuring code editors for Pigweed projects.

Editors and IDEs vary in the way they're configured and the options they
provide for configuration. As long as an editor uses files we can parse to
store its settings, this framework can be used to provide a consistent
interface to managing those settings in the context of a Pigweed project.

Ideally, we want to provide three levels of editor settings for a project:

- User settings (specific to the user's checkout)
- Project settings (included in source control, consistent for all users)
- Default settings (defined by Pigweed)

... where the settings on top can override (or cascade over) settings defined
below.

Some editors already provide mechanisms for achieving this, but in ways that
are particular to that editor, and many other editors don't provide this
mechanism at all. So we provide it in a uniform way here by adding a fourth
settings level, active settings, which are the actual settings files the editor
uses. Active settings are *built* (rather than edited or cloned) by looking for
user, project, and default settings (which are defined by Pigweed and ignored
by the editor) and combining them in the order described above. In this way,
Pigweed can provide sensible defaults, projects can define additional settings
to provide a uniform development experience, and users have the freedom to make
their own changes.
