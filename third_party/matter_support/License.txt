# Gecko SDK Licensing terms

Source code in this SDK is covered by one of several different licenses.
The default license is the Master Software License Agreement (MSLA) 
(https://www.silabs.com/about-us/legal/master-software-license-agreement),
which applies unless otherwise noted.

Some files use different licensing terms. If so, they will be clearly
marked in the beginning of the file.

Library files (either in archived or object form) are distributed under the
terms of the MSLA, with the following exceptions:

* Files under platform/radio/rail_lib/autogen/librail_release are distributed
  under the terms of the Zlib license.

Some code from third parties have been included in this SDK under a separate
license. An example can be found in the subdirectory "util/third_party". 
However, licensed third-party code is not limited to this directory.
